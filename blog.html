											<h2>What is “Big Software”?</h2>
											<p>Is it just our imagination, or has software become massive? The prevalence and scale of software is growing exponentially in tandem with the massive expansion in power of computing and networking technology. As the size of this Big Software increases, so grows the scale of risks and the need for coordination and control which are already today beyond manual management.
Just as the word Big Data is used to mean a data set with size beyond the ability of commonly used computing tools, the definition of Big Software is a system with size, complexity and dynamics beyond the comprehension and control of traditional software organizations and their methods. Like Big Data, Big Software calls for a new paradigm of more intelligent processing tools and technology. Today we live in a world where a hybrid mobile Hello World application with all its open source dependencies is composed of more than a thousand open source components and million+ lines of code! Who really knows what happens when all that code evolves on weekly basis in the open source upstream like it does?</p>
											<h2>Modern Software Supply Chain Trends Driving Big Software</h2>
											<p>The emergence of Big Software is a result of multiple parallel trends which have been cross-pollinating for more than a decade. Today a critical mass of system size is being reached in the enterprises that are leading the digital transformation of their respective industries.</p>
<h2>Cloud Infrastructure</h2>
<p>A massive shift towards SaaS computing on public cloud services makes adoption of new software infrastructure a degree of magnitude easier than before. This increases the size of software systems fast.</p>
<h2>DevOps</h2>
<p>The DevOps approach and processes linking development, QA and other departments to support cross-functional development continues to spread rapidly. Additionally, the examination of code iterations for efficiency with formerly manual processes are being automated as much as possible and this automation significantly increases the amount of software being included.</p>
<h2>Open Source Software</h2>
<p>OSS is the foundation of modern software and makes up 80–90% of all new projects & 95% of downloads are sourced from public repositories. Additionally, the OSS enablement market continues to grow rapidly alongside the broadening use of OSS in more than 95%+ of newly developed software projects across private and public organizations.</p>
<h2>Software Security</h2>
<p>The demand and expectation of continuous identification and fixing of vulnerabilities is now an absolute requirement and firms have established programs that will leverage a shift to automation across vulnerability detection, revert/shutdown, deployment fix processes.
Without comprehensive software visibility and control, a tier-1 enterprise is always just one systemic vulnerability away from a security disaster, wastes scarce developer resource and is not able to competitively harness the innovation and efficiency potential available through its software ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Why Software Intelligence?</h2>
<p>So Big Software essentially means that we have a situation of runaway expansion. But this is not OK. We need to regain control. We at Codescoop believe that this can be achieved through broad, deep and qualitative data about our software coupled with intelligent analysis that powers automated policy application and decision making. That’s why we have developed the Codescoop technology: to provide insight into your code and to regain control over your software which has turned Big. We call this technology Software Intelligence.

Codescoop tackles the Big Software challenge by providing a 360 degree view of your software stacks.
Software Intelligence requires Big Data about software. This means a pervasive, non-intrusive and automated process to centrally track sourcing, creation and deployment of all pieces of enterprise software. All significant attributes of software modules need to be tracked, like for example vulnerabilities, origins, commits, fixes, IP rights and obligations. Upon this foundation an enterprise can establish complete analytical insight over its software. Insight enables efficient action, and subsequently requires the automatic enforcement of local/global policies that control mission critical operations.</p>
<h2>Codescoop Software Intelligence Platform</h2>
<p>Codescoop Enterprise continuously gathers all possible data about software from both public sources and private sources inside the enterprise. These include source code version control and binary repositories, CI/CD systems, issue trackers, discussion and Q&A sites, employee and organization catalogues, documentation databases and numerous other sources. By combining and correlating this data Codescoop is able to provide deep insights about how companies are using code.
Because software stacks have become so large and complex, companies struggle with them in multiple ways. They need to understand what their stacks consist of, to stay up to date about which components have changed and why, and to know what is the true cost of software and products and which code puts them at risk. Codescoop helps software developers and leaders to see all this and to make informed decisions for better code quality and time to market and lower cost.
Our customers often say: “There’s a ton of software related data inside our enterprise but getting to it and making sense of it in context with our R&D decisions is really hard”. Much in the same way that Business Intelligence software assembles the scattered business data and helps companies make business decisions, Codescoop Software Intelligence solution helps engineering leaders and developers make data-driven decisions about their code based on facts.

											<h2>Hello World! We’re Codescoop.</h2>
											<p>Hello from Helsinki, San Francisco, and Barcelona. We founded Codescoop in 2017 as a distributed team and have been toiling away at an Enterprise edition, which is now up and running in several large companies, and will be announcing a free Developer edition soon. More on that in a few months. For now, let’s talk about what we do and introduce the concept of software intelligence…</p>

											<h2>Software Intelligence is…</h2>
											<p>Simply do a search for top business intelligence software tools and you will find that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of tools for business intelligence. BI software has helped businesses for years measure the health of their, well, business.
It is almost surely a truism to state that software engineers are very analytical people, yet we have lacked our own ways of analyzing code at scale. That’s not to say that there aren’t plenty of code scanning programs such as static code analysis. Those systems are fantastic (we use them ourselves!) for answering specific questions about security or code quality, but they are not capturing the bigger picture to answer the questions: how is my software doing today? And how will it be doing tomorrow?
To answer the bigger picture questions, we need to be gathering a lot of data; not just what’s in the code, but metadata from the entire software supply chain — from commits to builds to the community supporting it. This also includes news, blogs, and hullabaloo from the interwebz. All of this correlated data can be combined to provide a big picture overview of the software used inside of your repo.
Because more than 90% of code used by companies contains open source components (the number varies from report to report depending on how it’s being measured), that meant we needed to provide a way to analyze code wherever it lives — in the public domain, private cloud-hosted repos, or on-premise behind firewalls.
We wanted to build a product that helps companies and development answer questions such as:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>What percent of my code is out of date?</li>
  <li>What is the best component to use for my project?</li>
  <li>What dependencies are in my code?</li>
	<li>What license types are in my code?</li>
	<li>Are there libraries, components, or frameworks already in-use in my company that I could leverage for my work?</li>
	<li>How is my company contributing to the OSS projects we depend on?</li>
	<li>How is the broader software community contributing projects we open sourced?</li>
	<li>Should I pick an internal, proprietary or open source component to use in my new feature?</li>
</ul></p>
											<h2>Open for Business</h2>
											<p>We have been working diligently for months with a small team spread across two continents and eight countries to build a product that answers the aforementioned questions… and then some! We are now shipping to several large innovative companies to help them answer questions about their code and then take action.
We’re super excited to finally share what we’ve been working on! As mentioned at the start, we will soon have a beta that anyone can try. Over the next few months, we will be blogging more about the work we’re doing, the open source projects we are leveraging and contributing back to to build Codescoop, and some interesting findings along the way.</p>
